## Work

- Did a bunch of pair programming at work. This is hands down the most I’ve done at any job and it’s been great for onboarding.

## Side Projects

- Recorded podcast episode talking about take home interview projects and how to get the most out of it
- First time editing a podcast episode! Gave it a shot in Garageband and it worked out reasonably well
