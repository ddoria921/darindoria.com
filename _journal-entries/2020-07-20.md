## Work

- Starting Shape Up. I read most of the Shape Up book last week and although Iâ€™ve only spent a few days with this new process, it feels like itâ€™s a major improvement. I feel like Iâ€™m collaborating more with my team and focusing my time on the work that matters.

## Side Projects

- Researching how to build App Extensions for iOS.
- Wrote a post with tips for doing a screencasts. Iâ€™ll need to edit it some more before itâ€™s ready to publish.
- Started working on building my blog! Adding it to my existing Next.js site was easier than I expected. Iâ€™ll get this deployed at some point within next week.
