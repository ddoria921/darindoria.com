## Work

- Figured out a solid abstraction for rendering activity feed text in a way that plays well with internationalized text.
- Researching other activity feed designs. Trying to see what ideas we could pull in to enhance the experience.

## Side Projects

- Deployed fixes to work-journal page. Removed card swiping on non-touch devices to allow for text selection. Plus a few other minor fixes.
- Start on revamping my personal website’s homepage. Finally getting rid of that “in progress” placeholder! Made some good progress on the design, but have some tweaking left to do. Gonna keep this first iteration simple.
