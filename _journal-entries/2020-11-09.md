## Work

- Replaced some JS code used for dynamic column alignment with a simple `<table/>`. Been a while since I needed to use that, but it came in handy.
- Working through several bug fixes. Each one teaches me more and more about the codebase.

## Side Projects

- Tweaking light/dark mode styling for personal site homepage
- Deployed update homepage [Link](https://darindoria-website-git-chore-upgrade-to-tailwind-v19.ddoria.vercel.app)
- Updated personal site to Tailwind v1.9 and to Next.js v10

## Interesting Things
