- Started using Next.js for the first time
- Having established patterns for you is great
- I feel way less lost than last time I used `create-react-app`
- First time using React since hooks were announced
- Still not used to using `className`
- Rendering lists and conditional elements feels less natural than Ember’s template helpers
- Hooks don’t feel like a natural pattern at first
- Components being just functions is super intuitive
