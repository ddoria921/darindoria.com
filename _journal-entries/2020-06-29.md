## Learnings

- You can set up insensitive attribute matching with `i` in CSS. [Link](https://alvaromontoro.com/blog/67839/case-insensitive-selectors-in-css)
- Started using Next.js for the first time. Having established patterns is great. I feel way less lost compared to using `create-react-app`.
- First time using React hooks. It was odd at first, but having seen so many talks on it I at least had an idea of what hooks were available and which one to use.
- Creating a new component is as simple as returning html from a function. This makes splitting out multiple components in one file super easy.
